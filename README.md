The repository demonstrates three techniques for generating links to public files stored in the webnative filesystem:

- Public links always link to the latest version of a file
- Archival links permanently link to one version of a file
- Versioned links are links retrieved from the webnative [Versions](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative#versioning).

Please see the [Linking to Public Files](https://talk.fission.codes/t/linking-to-public-files/1716) post and the [Webnative SDK guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative) for more details.
